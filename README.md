Complete Zimbra Mailbox to PST Migration - Emails, contacts, Calendars, Briefcase etc.

Zimbra Desktop is a FREE email application, which is supported by multiple operating systems – Windows, Macintosh and Linux. It provides support to manage multiple user accounts (gmail, yahoomail etc.) in single window, each having their own set of data which includes emails, contacts, notes, tasks, calendars etc. saved as a mailbox. When a user extracts backup from Zimbra, each user account mailbox is saved in a separate file, containing all the items. The extracted file has the extension of .tgz which is a zipped file. 

Outlook on the other hand, is a Windows product which comes bundled with MS Office suite. Thus, it is operable on Windows OS only. (Though Mac editions of Outlook are also available - Outlook 2011 for Mac is included with Office 2011 for Mac and Outlook for Mac (v15.3 build 141024) is included with Office365). MS Outlook serves as a Personal Information Manager that independently manages all the emails, contacts, journals, calendars, notes etc. and saves all its data in a single PST file.

When users want to migrate data from Zimbra to Outlook, they find that neither application supports direct Importing/exporting of mailbox data between them. So the only option is to convert Zimbra Email data to PST format. And to get 100% successful results, it’s better to use a third party Zimbra Mailbox to PST Migration tool that will help in migrating data from Zimbra to Outlook. You can download the software from the official site : http://www.softspire.com/zimbra-converter/
